    com.google.appengine.runtime.environment is "Production" when running on App Engine, and "Development" when running in the development server.

    In addition to using System.getProperty(), you can access system properties using our type-safe API. For example:
{{{
    if (SystemProperty.environment.value() ==
        SystemProperty.Environment.Value.Production) {
        // The app is running on App Engine...
    }
}}}
    com.google.appengine.runtime.version is the version ID of the runtime environment, such as "1.3.0". You can get the version by invoking the following: String version = SystemProperty.version.get();
    com.google.appengine.application.id is the application's ID. You can get the ID by invoking the following: String ID = SystemProperty.applicationId.get();
