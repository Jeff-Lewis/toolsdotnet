#summary Specific of logging in ASP.NET Web sites and applications

= Introduction =

Either you create a web project as a "web site" or "web application". Logging in it has got its own specifics.
That is mostly affected by understanding the security account your application runs under and conditional compilation.


= Details =
==Conditional Compilation==
Do you use TraceSource or Trace in your web application or web site, but don't see it really logging?
Does it skip over the trace lines in the debugger?
Then you are most probably facing the conditional compilation issues. Trace methods have are attributed with the [Conditional("TRACE")], so unless this conditional compilation constant is set, those methods will not get compiled.

Phil Haack has an excellent information onto conditional compilation specifics for web apps [http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/16/conditional-compilation-constants-and-asp.net.aspx]
