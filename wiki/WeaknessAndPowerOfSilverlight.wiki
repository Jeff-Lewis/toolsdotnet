= What is weak =
== Testing ==
IsolatedStorageFile - IDisposable, no other interface
No own, first class citizen testing framework
No own CI (point to Statlight)

== Blend programming model ==
-- Association with TIBCO programming model, point on testability/verification again
Often we can't see design view as of "errors" that are not really errors

== Cooperation between designer and coder ==

== Scalability ==

== Binding hurdles ==
Very hard to verify, troubleshoot when binding is not working properly

== Exception handling ==
Swallowing exceptions

== Readiness and support for MVVM ==

== Speed of verification ==
Need to build to see the result

== Design decisions ==

== Versioning and backward support ==
The story of SL3 to SL4. Moving System.Action from System to System.Core

== Tooling ==
VS 2010 is quite flaky on Silverlight. And more debugging and builds you more unstable it becomes, causing need to restart and thus loosing time.

== Complexity of asynchronous programmming ==
Provide examples of bugs in well-known framework like CLog for example
Mix of async and sync API (like old one Isolated storage api).
== Overlooked bugs caused by async programming non-readiness ==
Sometimes it is just very complex to synchronize all async stuff

== You can't show/convert html==
This kind of a tough thing. Quite often your customers are giving you those chunks of html they crafted and want to you for the LOB app customization. You/they become pretty limited here.
See: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/delay/archive/2007/09/10/bringing-a-bit-of-html-to-silverlight-htmltextblock-makes-rich-text-display-easy.aspx for at least some remediation. BUT THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION!
Looks like there is an ability to integrate webbrowser control into your application in Windows Phone 7 though.

== No MVVM support for javascript integration ==

It would be good we we had Javascript Command binding javascript events with ViewModel commands.
