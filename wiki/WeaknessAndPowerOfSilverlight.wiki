= What is weak =
== Testing ==
IsolatedStorageFile - IDisposable, no other interface
No own, first class citizen testing framework
No own CI (point to Statlight)

== Blend programming model ==
-- Association with TIBCO programming model, point on testability/verification again
Often we can't see design view as of "errors" that are not really errors

== Cooperation between designer and coder ==

== Scalability ==

== Binding hurdles ==
Very hard to verify, troubleshoot when binding is not working properly

== Exception handling ==
Swallowing exceptions
== Environment readiness for MVVM ==

== Speed of verification ==
Need to build to see the result

== Design decisions ==

== Versioning and backward support ==
The story of SL3 to SL4. Moving System.Action from System to System.Core
