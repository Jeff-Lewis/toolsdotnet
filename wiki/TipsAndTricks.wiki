== How to register vs 2008/9 environment variables ==
So you can execute then gacutil, ildasm whatever without providing a path. I guess this is just what VS Command Line does, but never had a time to look. Sample from the Tess's blog:
-----
CALL "%VS90COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat" > NULL 
gacutil.exe /if "$(TargetPath)"
 
this will add the assembly to the GAC when you build.  Note that on 2005 you would have to change the path to be %VS80COMNTOOLS% rather than %VS90COMNTOOLS%
