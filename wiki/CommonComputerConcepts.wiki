= Bootstrap = 
{{{
The term boot is short for bootstrap, and the metaphor
is to imagine a person wearing boots who reaches down, pulls on their bootstraps,
and lifts themselves into the air. Of course, this only is possible in cartoons,
but it is a vivid image. With the power off, a computer is a dead hunk of silicon,
steel, and wires. During the boot process, it has to wake up, find all of its
peripherals, and configure itself to run software. It takes some doing to make
all of this happen.
