== Have a windbg lab to see where timesten is located when it runs in the direct link mode. ==

"An application can create a direct driver connection when it runs on the same
machine as the TimesTen database. In a direct driver connection, the ODBC
driver directly loads the TimesTen database into either the applicationâ€™s heap
space or a shared memory segment. The application then uses the direct driver to
access the memory image of the database. Because no inter-process
communication (IPC) of any kind is required, a direct-driver connection provides
extremely fast performance and is the preferred way for applications to access
TimesTen databases."
