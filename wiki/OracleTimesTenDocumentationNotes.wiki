== Have a windbg lab to see where timesten is located when it runs in the direct link mode. ==

"An application can create a direct driver connection when it runs on the same
machine as the TimesTen database. In a direct driver connection, the ODBC
driver directly loads the TimesTen database into either the applicationâ€™s heap
space or a shared memory segment. The application then uses the direct driver to
access the memory image of the database. Because no inter-process
communication (IPC) of any kind is required, a direct-driver connection provides
extremely fast performance and is the preferred way for applications to access
TimesTen databases."

If I understand it correctly then, MS ODBC .NET driver should be using the "Driver manager connection" option. It is only layer of indirection and should still correspond to the direct link if accessed from the same machine. This to be verified by "Proposed hands ons".
