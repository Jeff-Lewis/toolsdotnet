== custom sound ==
{{{
localNotification.soundName = UILocalNotificationDefaultSoundName;
}}}

== repeating notification ==

{{{
localNotification.repeatInterval = NSHourCalendarUnit;
}}}

== custom data in local notification ==

{{{
NSDictionary *infoDict=[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"1234" forKey:@"IDkey"];
localNotification.userInfo = infoDict
}}}

== schedule or not ==

nce you have created an instance of UILocalNotification, you schedule it using one of two methods of the UIApplication class: scheduleLocalNotification: or presentLocalNotificationNow:.

_I need to use *presentLocalNotificationNow* to avoid user mingling with the app before notification is shown. No need to set fireDate and timeZone then_

== handling states ==

If the notification is an *alert* and the user taps the action button (or, if the device is locked, drags open the action slider), the application is launched. _When it is an alert and when it is not??_
