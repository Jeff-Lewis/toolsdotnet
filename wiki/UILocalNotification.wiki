== schedule or not ==

nce you have created an instance of UILocalNotification, you schedule it using one of two methods of the UIApplication class: scheduleLocalNotification: or presentLocalNotificationNow:.

_I need to use *presentLocalNotificationNow* to avoid user mingling with the app before notification is shown. No need to set fireDate and timeZone then_

== handling states ==

If the notification is an *alert* and the user taps the action button (or, if the device is locked, drags open the action slider), the application is launched. _When it is an alert and when it is not??_

== Alert or not - Action thingy - Experiment with that ==

hasAction
A Boolean value that controls whether the notification shows or hides the alert action.
{{{
@property(nonatomic) BOOL hasAction
}}}
Discussion
Assign NO to this property to hide the alert button or slider. (This effect requires alertBody to be non-nil.) The default value is YES.
