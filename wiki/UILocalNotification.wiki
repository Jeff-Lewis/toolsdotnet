== schedule or not ==

nce you have created an instance of UILocalNotification, you schedule it using one of two methods of the UIApplication class: scheduleLocalNotification: or presentLocalNotificationNow:.

_I need to use *presentLocalNotificationNow* to avoid user mingling with the app before notification is shown. No need to set fireDate and timeZone then_
