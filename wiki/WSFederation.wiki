Requestor

Resource

== Attribute service ==
When requestors interact with resources in different trust realms (or different parts of a
federation), there is often a need to know additional information about the requestor in
order to authorize, process, or personalize the experience. A service, known as an Attribute Service may be available within a realm or federation. As such, an attribute service is used to provide the attributes about a requestor that are relevant to the completion of a request, given that the service is authorized to obtain this information. This approach allows the sharing of data between authorized entities.

== Pseudonym service ==
To facilitate single sign-on where multiple identities need to be automatically mapped and
the privacy of the principal needs to be maintained, there may also be a pseudonym
service. A pseudonym service allows a principal to have different aliases at different
resources/services or in different realms, and to optionally have the pseudonym change perservice or per-login. While some scenarios support identities that are trusted as presented, pseudonyms services allow those cases where identity mapping needs to occur between an identity and a pseudonym on behalf of the principal.
